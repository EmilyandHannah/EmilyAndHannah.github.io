<h2>How we're making this site:</h2>
<p>My <strong><em>awesome</em></strong> cousin and I are making this site together on <a href = "www.github.com">www.github.com.</a> Github is great for sharing projects with others, and
<br>editing yours and others's code! Now, enough advertising for Github! You want to know what this site is about!<br>
This site will be all about our absolute coolest things we find and do. You'll be able to decide what you want to see based on a link-based webpage-jump.<br>
also, see: <a href = "https://hannahbananabutt.github.io/Home"> my site!</a> We really hope you enjoy this site!
